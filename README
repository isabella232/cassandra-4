TODO(jjo):                                                  [2012/Sep/24]
* [P0]  Support setting an invalid volume-map (JSON syntax) - ie don't
        assume we've 'lost' our volume assignment
* [P0]  Create helper scripts to scrape euca-describe-volumes, and 'merge'
        with juju status output, to:
        - fire attachments, then:
        - set a proper volume-map (instance->volume)
* [P1]  Fix DELAY_START_UNTIL_VOLUME logic/state transition
* [P2]  Support migrating to a new extra volume?
