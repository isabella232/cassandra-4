TODO(jjo):  [2012/Sep/25]
* [P0]  Support setting an invalid volume-map (JSON syntax) - ie don't
        assume we've 'lost' our volume assignment
* [P0]  Review state/needed configs/etc in case of "re-attaching" set
        of volumes into a fresh new deployment (should serve data
        present in volume-s, never start cassandra with "fresh"/nil data)
* [P0]  Fix DELAY_START_UNTIL_VOLUME logic/state transition
* [P1]  Create helper scripts to scrape euca-describe-volumes, and 'merge'
        with juju status output, to:
        - fire attachments, then:
        - set a proper volume-map (instance->volume)
* [P2]  Support migrating to a new extra volume?
